DESCRIPTION

    A repository of definition for building Singularity* containers 
    around the software applications, frameworks, and libraries you need
    to run on high-performance computing systems.

    * https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide

USAGE

     1. Install Singularity on your Linux desktop, laptop, or virtual
        machine. 

            ./naked-singularity.sh install

     2. Build a simple base Ubuntu Singularity container. 

            sudo singularity build ubuntu.sif definition-files/ubuntu/Singularity.ubuntu-18.04

        A number of pre-built containers from this repository are also 
        now hosted at both Singularity Hub

            singularity pull shub://mkandes/naked-singularity:ubuntu-18.04
   
        and Sylabs' Container Library

            singularity pull library://mkandes/naked-singularity:ubuntu-18.04

     3. Uninstall Singularity from your Linux desktop, laptop, or 
        virtual machine.

            ./naked-singularity.sh uninstall

STATUS

    This repository is currently undergoing a major restructuring. 
    Significant changes over the next few weeks should be expected.

CONTRIBUTE

    If you would like to contribute one of your own Singularity 
    container definition files for a specific application OR request 
    a modification to an existing container definition, then please
    submit a pull request.
